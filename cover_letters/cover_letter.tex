I am writing to apply for the JOB\_TITLE position available at COMPANY\_NAME. As a student at the University of Michigan, in the College of Engineering, I had the opportunity to talk with you at the Universityâ€™s semi-annual career fair in the fall. [Add in a little personal verbiage here]. I plan to graduate in the spring of 2017 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Engineering. This makes me well suited for the JOB\_TITLE as well as future with COMPANY\_NAME.

Computer Science Engineering coursework will lay a solid foundation for these careers in software design. However, my extracurricular experiences are what demonstrate my potential to succeed as a software engineer. One of these was my time spent with the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program during my freshman year. I assisted a professor on campus who researched transient objects (things that go bang) in the night sky. I gained experience analyzing data and writing scripts using IDL to supplement her research. Much of this work was done independently and thus I had to demonstrate self-motivation and learn to enforce my own deadlines. Another extracurricular activity I am involved in currently is the Michigan Autonomous Aerial Vehicles project team. Within this team I was asked to contribute solutions and ideas for navigation and computer search algorithms. This experience is giving me the opportunity to solve real life problems and apply the coursework I am currently learning. Both of these extra-curricular activities prepare me well for the JOB\_TITLE.

I have the skills and experience to perform the tasks of JOB\_TITLE to high standards. I can be an asset toward COMPANY\_NAME's future growth and prosperity. I look forward to demonstrating that upon further contact.
